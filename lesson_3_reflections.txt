lesson 4
github lets you manually decide when you want to update your github repository. \

First you need to create an empty repository. remote repositires are called
"remotes". You can push and pull data to and from remotes. You specify a branch
and all the commits for that branch are sent.

if the commit is already in githubs repository, it won't get sent. only the
commits for your branch will be pushed to github.

$ git remote add remote_repository_name repo_url

adds a remote repository (e.g. github repo) to your local git repository.

$ git remote

lists the remotes you have in the git repository.

$ git remote -v

this also give the URL you will fetch data from and push data to.

$ git push remote_repository_name local_branch_name

by default, the branch created in github will have the same name as the local
branch name you pushed.

you can create and edit plain text files directly on the github website.

$ git pull remote_repository_name remote_branch_name

you want to have the right branch name checked out


When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
When you are working with others, or when you want to be able to access your work
from outside your local machine.

Remote is basically a reference to another repository

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you want to have control over the changes to the branches you are
pulling, so that you know what version of code you are using / have on your
machine.
