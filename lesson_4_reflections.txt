lesson 4
github lets you manually decide when you want to update your github repository. \

First you need to create an empty repository. remote repositires are called
"remotes". You can push and pull data to and from remotes. You specify a branch
and all the commits for that branch are sent.

if the commit is already in githubs repository, it won't get sent. only the
commits for your branch will be pushed to github.

$ git remote add remote_repository_name repo_url

adds a remote repository (e.g. github repo) to your local git repository.

$ git remote

lists the remotes you have in the git repository.

$ git remote -v

this also give the URL you will fetch data from and push data to.

$ git push remote_repository_name local_branch_name

by default, the branch created in github will have the same name as the local
branch name you pushed.
