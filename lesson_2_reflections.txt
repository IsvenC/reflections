What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialise you create the .git file that tracks all the commits. You
need to do that so that versions are tracked and added.

$ git add <file>
e.g. $ git add helloworld.py

adds a file to the staging area.

'Changes to be committed' lists files to be added to the staging area

$ git reset <file>

removes the fu=ile from the staging area, but keeps it in your working directory
If you accidentally add a file to the staging area, you can remove it using git
reset. For example, if you accidentally add lesson_2_reflections.txt, but donâ€™t
want it to be committed yet, run git reset lesson_2_reflections.txt and the file
will be removed from the staging area, but it will still be in your working
directory.
